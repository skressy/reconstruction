# 2.5D Polar Reconstruction

This folder contains tools for reconstructing magnetic fields from synthetic polarimetry observations.

## Scripts

- **2D_Recon.py** - Partially reconstructs a magnetic field from mock polarimetry observations
- **recon_functions.py** - Contains reconstruction functions and plotting utilities
- **data_gen.py** - Generates toy models as Stokes U/Q information from template magnetic fields

## Overview

The workflow generates synthetic magnetic field data, performs reconstruction analysis, and visualizes results using the provided utility functions.
