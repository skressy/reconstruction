Welcome to the development version of MAGIC-3D.

Folder **25D_polar_recon** contains scripts for 2.5D magnetic field reconstruction with **polarimetry** data only.
It focuses only on magnetic field structure, i.e. ignoring density, turbulence, grain effects. 
The script uses a variety of templates to test the validity of the reconstruction equations. 

Folder **25D_zeeman_recon** contains scripts for 2.5D magnetic field reconstruction, 
but now with **polarimetry**, **Zeeman**, **DCF**, and **turbulence** information.
